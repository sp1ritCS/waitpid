waitpid - a simple command-line utility to wait for a foreign process
to exit.

Description
-----------
The `waitpid` utility is a simple command-line tool that waits for a
process with a given PID to exit.

Since it uses the pidfd_open system call, the tool is only compatible
with operating systems/kernels that implement the pidfd family of
syscalls, like GNU/Linux.

Installation
------------
To install `waitpid`, run the following commands:

    $ make
    $ install -m755 build/waitpid <prefix>/bin/waitpid

Usage
-----
To use `waitpid`, simply provide the PID of the process you want to wait for as a positional argument:

    $ waitpid 1234

You can also specify the following options:

    -t, --timeout <seconds>       Set a timeout in seconds
    -s, --timeout-status <status> Set the timeout status (default: 124)
    -v, --verbose                 Increase verbosity
    -h, --help                    Display help information and exit
    -V, --version                 Display version information and exit
